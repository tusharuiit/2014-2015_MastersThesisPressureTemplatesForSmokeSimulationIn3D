# Master's Thesis Titled "Pressure Templates for 3D Smoke Simulation" in the Mantaflow Framework : [http://mantaflow.com](http://mantaflow.com)"#

This was my first independent project in an already existing large framework in C++ to solve "Fluid Simulation for Computer Graphics" Problems with finite difference discretization. I learnt to use already existing functionalities and APIs of a given framework and adding source files from outside world to my customized goals.

The files written and modified by me are
source/plugin/pressure.cpp
/scenes/mine
scenes/report

The files added by me from outside are :
source/stb_image_write.h
source/stb_image.h.

Apart from that I used the Mitsuba renderer to render my scenes, aubiocut to use beat detection etc.

The report PDF and the video results are included in my resume. This project also involved a lot of mathematical thinking.
